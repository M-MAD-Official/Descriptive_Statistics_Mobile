## Usage
Just replace `data` variable's value and adjust the `data_type` and
`number_of_classes` variables accordingly and then run the script to get the
full statistic report.

In case of `Continuous` data_type, setting `precise_intervals` determines that
intervals between each class should be rounded (`False` value) or kept as
float (`True` value). Setting `calculate_q` and `calculate_d` values make the
program calculate and print Quartiles and Deciles of `Continuous` data.
