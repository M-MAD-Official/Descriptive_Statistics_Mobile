# Installation guide for Android (using PyDroid3)
Android installation can be done in two ways, one way is to use PyDroid3 and
the other (also recommended) one is using the Termux app. Using PyDroid3 is
more straight forward but it have some issues rendering the Frequency

1. Install PyDroid3 from
[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3).
2. Download the program zip file from the

and extract it to a folder.
3. Open up PyDroid3 and tap the ⋮ (three dots) button on the top-right
corner of the screen, then tap the `Open`.

to and select `main.py`.

then tap the `Pip`.
